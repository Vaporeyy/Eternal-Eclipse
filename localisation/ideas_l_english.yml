 PRC_Technocratic_Society_idea:0 "Technocratic Society"
 PRC_Technocratic_Society_idea_desc:0 "China's extensive efforts in developing and advancing digital technology have brought about a technologically proficient society. Civilian life is dominated by online programs such as the social credit system, and transactions are made almost entirely online. These developments have given the CPC great control of civilian life by being able to more directly monitor and direct civilian life. Overall, civilians feel more pressure to behave accordingly or else they'll forfeit access to services, or worse. China's society is one firmly ruled by the technological systems of the CPC."
 PRC_Aggressive_Outlook_idea:0 "Agressive Outlook"
 PRC_Aggressive_Outlook_idea_desc:0 "The CPC makes use of China's technological, industrial, and military might to spread its influence abroad. Given the CPC's militaristic doctrine, this is done in an aggressive and strong manner. Strength and industrial power are China's primary tools for influencing nations and securing alliances worldwide."
 PRC_Fractured_Party_idea:0 "Fractured Party"
 PRC_Fractured_Party_idea_desc:0 "In the midst of China's political and economic depression in the 2020s, the CPC went through great change. The capitalistic policies of the XI Jinping era came to an end, and a new wave of Chinese communists emerged. Neo-Maoists, New Leftists, and all manner of opponents to the CPC's status quo came into the forefront and sought to transform the party through their vision. By now, the party has reached a stable point through the Neo Maoists, but is still fractured between different groups and may see another era of change"
 PRC_Neo_Maoism_idea:0 "Neo Maoism"
 PRC_Neo_Maoism_idea_desc:0 "With the departure from a capitalist mode of production and consolidation of new management, the CPC became dominated by neo-Maoists and other opponents to the Xi Jinping era party. This new management set out to reshape Chinese culture and society by promoting traditional Maoist virtues and leftist thought as well as nationalist pride and devotion to the state. China's new ideology is also based around nationalization of industry and resources and a socialistic mode of production. In general, it is seen as a successor to Bo Xilai's Chongqing Model of the late 2000s."

 SYR_Slow_Reconstruction_idea:0 "Slow Reconstruction"
 SYR_Slow_Reconstruction_idea_desc:0 "The Syrian Civil War may have ended over a decade ago, but its destructiveness still affects Syria. Due to the sheer cost and magnitude of the reconstruction, inefficient foreign aid, and internal instability, the government has been unable to efficiently reconstruct the nation. Much of Syria remains destroyed and incapable of production.   "
 SYR_Excessive_Repression_idea:0 "Excessive Repression"
 SYR_Excessive_Repression_idea_desc:0 "With each passing year since his victory, Assad's rule grows more contested. He has not been able to carry Syria from post-war destruction, and the population is getting restless. As opposition rises, Assad grows more paranoid and unwilling to give up the power he fought to keep. This has led to waves of excessive repression of dissidents in order to assure a smooth reign."
 SYR_The_Kurdish_Problem_idea:0 "The Kurdish Problem"
 SYR_The_Kurdish_Problem_idea_desc:0 "Despite having been defeated in the Syrian Civil War and hounded after the war, Kurdish militias have reemerged and are resisiting the government's repression and poor reconstruction efforts. They have overrun the north easily due to their connections with anti-government groups, as well as opponents in the military refusing to cooperate with the government. This situation is a dire problem because it wastes resources and could inspire more uprisings if it succeeds, which is something the government may not be able to handle."
 SYR_Russian_Iranian_Rivalry_idea:0 "Russian Iranian Rivalry"
 SYR_Russian_Iranian_Rivalry_idea_desc:0 "Russia and Iran were the two biggest supporters of Assad during the civil war. However, once the war ended, they both sought to exert their influence over the nation. Both heavily invested in Syria's reconstruction and military, and compete for greater influence. The Syrian government has chosen to go more with Iran's investments over Russia's, and signed several deals with the Iranian government due to Iran's powerful position in the middle east, and Russia's decline. This escalated the rivalry and led Russia to incite anti-government sentiments among military collaborators and opposition groups from within the government "
