 FRA_Sixth_Republic_idea:0 "Sixth Republic"
 FRA_Sixth_Republic_idea_desc:0 "Upon taking power, La France Insoumise revolutionized French politics by writing a new consitution and declaring a Sixth Republic. This new constitution focuses on creating a more democratic, anti-capitalist, and socially responsible society. Constitutional rights of private ownership of capital were changed, ecology and social issues were addressed, and the government was made less authoritarian by having less power concentrated to the president. Overall, this movement has widespread support, but has drawn significant flak from centrist and right wing groups for being so radical and populist
 FRA_New_Ecological_Economy_idea:0 "New Ecological Economy"
 FRA_New_Ecological_Economy_idea_desc:0 "One of the main goals of La France Insoumise is to develop a green economy in order to lessen the nation's carbon footprint. Upon taking power, they have set out to do exactly this through various projects and overhauls, such as the ambitious energy transition plan, protection of common goods, and the green rule. Through the efforts of la France Insoumise, the nation has become a world leader in ecological sustainability. Although these efforts have been successful, they have cost an extraordinary amount, and have lessened the nation's production capabilities due to the strict environmental regulations on industry. "
 FRA_Maritime_Ambitions_idea:0 "Maritime Ambitions"
 FRA_Maritime_Ambitions_idea_desc:0 "Under La France Insoumise, France withdrew from NATO and limited its ties to the EU, thus placing the nation in a sensitive geopolitical position. It will need to rely on its own military in order to protect itself. The development of ground-based armed forces has not been prioritized due to France's tame relaions with its neighbors. However, France will need a strong navy to protect its trade and security on an international level, especially since NATO no longer supports it."
 FRA_EU_Treaty_Negotiations_idea:0 "EU Treaty Negotiations"
 FRA_EU_Treaty_Negotiations_idea_desc:0 "Due to la France Insoumise's euroscepticism, France has been negotiating a democratic refounding of EU treaties. These negotiations have been going on for several years and have been somewhat slow due to disagreements. The slow negotiations have led to France not being able to fully realize its goals of treaty refounding, and having inefficiency in its EU relations. Plan B, which entails exiting the EU is becoming a popular option due to this."
 FRA_Direct_Democracy_idea:0 "Direct Democracy"
 FRA_Direct_Democracy_idea_desc:0 "La France Insoumise has carried out several measures to increase direct democracy, most notably through the formation of proportional representation, the introduction of recall elections, and the repealing of Macron-era laws and systems. Through these measures, common citizens now have greater control over government institutions, services, and programs. People have become more participatory in government and thus feel more involved and represented in such matters. Overall, the initiatives have been a popular among the citizens of France now that the authoritarian systems of the fifth republic are undone."

 PRC_Technocratic_Society_idea:0 "Technocratic Society"
 PRC_Technocratic_Society_idea_desc:0 "China's extensive efforts in developing and advancing digital technology have brought about a technologically proficient society. Civilian life is dominated by online programs such as the social credit system, and transactions are made almost entirely online. These developments have given the CPC great control of civilian life by being able to more directly monitor and direct civilian life. Overall, civilians feel more pressure to behave accordingly or else they'll forfeit access to services, or worse. China's society is one firmly ruled by the technological systems of the CPC."
 PRC_Aggressive_Outlook_idea:0 "Agressive Outlook"
 PRC_Aggressive_Outlook_idea_desc:0 "The CPC makes use of China's technological, industrial, and military might to spread its influence abroad. Given the CPC's militaristic doctrine, this is done in an aggressive and strong manner. Strength and industrial power are China's primary tools for influencing nations and securing alliances worldwide."
 PRC_Fractured_Party_idea:0 "Fractured Party"
 PRC_Fractured_Party_idea_desc:0 "In the midst of China's political and economic depression in the 2020s, the CPC went through great change. The capitalistic policies of the XI Jinping era came to an end, and a new wave of Chinese communists emerged. Neo-Maoists, New Leftists, and all manner of opponents to the CPC's status quo came into the forefront and sought to transform the party through their vision. By now, the party has reached a stable point through the Neo Maoists, but is still fractured between different groups and may see another era of change"
 PRC_Neo_Maoism_idea:0 "Neo Maoism"
 PRC_Neo_Maoism_idea_desc:0 "With the departure from a capitalist mode of production and consolidation of new management, the CPC became dominated by neo-Maoists and other opponents to the Xi Jinping era party. This new management set out to reshape Chinese culture and society by promoting traditional Maoist virtues and leftist thought as well as nationalist pride and devotion to the state. China's new ideology is also based around nationalization of industry and resources and a socialistic mode of production. In general, it is seen as a successor to Bo Xilai's Chongqing Model of the late 2000s."

 SYR_Excessive_Repression_idea:0 "Excessive Repression"
 SYR_Excessive_Repression_idea_desc:0 "With each passing year since his victory, Assad's rule grows more contested. He has not been able to carry Syria from post-war destruction, and the population is getting restless. As opposition rises, Assad grows more paranoid and unwilling to give up the power he fought to keep. This has led to waves of excessive repression of dissidents in order to assure a smooth reign."
 SYR_The_Kurdish_Problem_idea:0 "The Kurdish Problem"
 SYR_The_Kurdish_Problem_idea_desc:0 "Despite having been defeated in the Syrian Civil War and hounded after the war, Kurdish militias have reemerged and are resisiting the government's repression and poor reconstruction efforts. They have overrun the north easily due to their connections with anti-government groups, as well as opponents in the military refusing to cooperate with the government. This situation is a dire problem because it wastes resources and could inspire more uprisings if it succeeds, which is something the government may not be able to handle."
 SYR_Russian_Iranian_Rivalry_idea:0 "Russian Iranian Rivalry"
 SYR_Russian_Iranian_Rivalry_idea_desc:0 "Russia and Iran were the two biggest supporters of Assad during the civil war. However, once the war ended, they both sought to exert their influence over the nation. Both heavily invested in Syria's reconstruction and military, and compete for greater influence. The Syrian government has chosen to go more with Iran's investments over Russia's, and signed several deals with the Iranian government due to Iran's powerful position in the middle east, and Russia's decline. This escalated the rivalry and led Russia to incite anti-government sentiments among military collaborators and opposition groups from within the government "
 SYR_Slow_reconstruction_idea:0 "Slow Reconstruction"
 SYR_Slow_reconstruction_idea_desc:0 "The Syrian Civil War may have ended over a decade ago, but its destructiveness still affects Syria. Due to the sheer cost and magnitude of the reconstruction, inefficient foreign aid, and internal instability, the government has been unable to efficiently reconstruct the nation. Much of Syria remains destroyed and incapable of production."
