 PRC_Technocratic_Society_idea_desc:0 "China's extensive efforts in developing and advancing digital technology have brought about a technologically proficient society. Civilian life is dominated by online programs such as the social credit system, and transactions are made almost entirely online. These developments have given the CPC great control of civilian life by being able to more directly monitor and control civilian life. Overall, civilians feel more pressure to behave accordingly or else they'll forfeit access to services, or worse. China's society is one firmly ruled by the technological systems of the CPC."

 PRC_Aggressive_Outlook_idea_desc:0 "The CPC makes use of China's technological, industrial, and military might to spread its influence abroad. Given the CPC's militaristic doctrine, this is done in an aggressive and strong manner. Strength and industrial power are China's primary tools for influencing nations and securing alliances worldwide."

 PRC_Fractured_Party_idea_desc:0 "In the midst of China's political and economic depression in the 2020s, the CPC went through great change. The capitalistic policies of the XI Jinping era came to an end, and a new wave of Chinese communists emerged. Neo-Maoists, New Leftists, and all manner of opponents to the CPC's status quo came into the forefront and sought to transform the party through their vision. By now, the party has reached a stable point through the Neo Maoists, but is still fractured between different groups and may see another era of change"

 PRC_Neo_Maoism_idea_desc:0 "With the departure from a capitalist mode of production and consolidation of new management, the CPC became dominated by neo-Maoists and other opponents to the Xi Jinping era party. This new management set out to reshape Chinese culture and society by promoting traditional Maoist virtues and leftist thought as well as nationalist pride and devotion to the state. China's new ideology is also based around nationalization of industry and resources and a socialistic mode of production. In general, it is seen as a successor to Bo Xilai's CHongqing Model of the late 2000s."
